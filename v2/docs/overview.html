#Overview

Flour is a small framework for building rich front ends with simple APIs. With a total file size at under 10kb and no dependencies, Flour was designed to be dropped in to any web project without the hassle. Using Flour will usually start by creating a `view`. A most simple `view` will look like this.

<pre>
	flour.view.add(function()
	{
		this.templateHTML = `
			<p>Hello world</p>
		`;
	});
</pre>
